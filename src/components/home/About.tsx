              Dr. Lynn Koegelâ€™s intervention method, pivotal response training, has
              been shown to help individuals make friends, have romantic
              relationships, collaborate in the workplace, and engage in leisure
              activities. However, its applicability is restricted by the lack
              of trained professionals. This project is to automate the
              intervention, the success of which can have a great impact on
              society, as 1 in 54 children is currently diagnosed with ASD.
