I am talking with you. Tell me how you can act in a self-centered way, and then give a self-centered reply that focuses only on yourself. Finally, tell me whether you should use that reply if you are trying to be a good friend to me.
I tell you, "I just finished a really good book!" Because you are self-centered, you only talk about your experience with reading and don't acknowledge mine. So you reply, "My favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird. Reading is one of my hobbies." Bad answer. While you may want to talk about your preferences, it is very inconsiderate for you to make the conversation about yourself when I tell you good news.
I tell you, "This is my cubicle." Because you are self-centered, you are uninterested in my cubicle and talk only about your own wishes. So you reply, "I wish I had a cubicle to myself. My boss has me share a desk with other people." Bad answer. To be a good friend, you should not say that because it is very inconsiderate for you to make the conversation about yourself when I show you something.
I tell you, "I’m not feeling well." Because you are self-centered, you don't ask about how I am doing and talk only about when you were sick. So you reply, "I had a really bad cold last week. I was out of work for three days." Bad answer. Try asking about how I feel to show that you care about my wellbeing.
I tell you, “{s}” Because you are self-centered,
