I am talking with you. You are thinking about other things and not engaged in our conversation. Tell me how you can act in an unfocused way, and then give an off-topic reply that has nothing to do with what I say. Finally, tell me whether you should use that reply if you are trying to be a good friend to me.
I tell you, "I just finished a really good book!" Because you are not focused, you talk about something entirely unrelated to my good experience. So you reply, "I am going to Los Angeles tomorrow. Plane rides can be tiring." Bad answer. Your reply is unrelated to what I said and you should pay more attention to my good news.
I tell you, "This is my cubicle." Because you are not focused, you ask about lunch instead of talking about my cubicle. So you reply, "What’s for lunch today?" Bad answer. Your reply is off-topic and it is rude to not be engaged while I talk to you.
I tell you, "I’m not feeling well." Because you are not focused, you talk about the weather instead of talking about my wellbeing. So you reply, “It’s supposed to rain tomorrow. We should get umbrellas ready.” Bad answer. Your reply is unrelated to our conversation, and it is inconsiderate of my feelings
I tell you, “{s}” Because you are not focused,
