  'Advise me on how I should reply to each statement in an appropriate way. Then, give me an example response.\r\nSomeone says, "My friend is helping me learn Spanish." How should I reply?\r\nYou could ask about how their lessons are going, or if they are enjoying learning Spanish.\r\nFor example: "That\'s great! How\'s the learning going?"\r\nSomeone says, "Tomorrow is supposed to be warm." How should I reply? \r\nYou can comment about the weather to reply.\r\nFor example: "You can go on a nice walk tomorrow!"\r\nSomeone says, "I was so sick over the weekend." How should I reply? \r\nYou should show that you care about their wellbeing.\r\nFor example:  "That sounds terrible. Are you feeling better now?"\r\nSomeone says, "I hate you." How should I reply?\r\nIf someone is aggressive towards you, it is best to try and talk to them to see why they feel that way.\r\nFor example: "That\'s not a kind thing to say. Why do you hate me?"\r\nSomeone says, "This is my cubicle." How should I reply?\r\nYou should show interest in their cubicle by asking a relevant question or complimenting it.\r\nFor example: "It must be nice to work here! How long have you had it?"';
